# Hierarchical-Data-Storage-With-Trees
A practice project to test an implementation of hierarchical file storage with trees

This is one implementation of the theoretical concept of trees. However, I do not klnow if this is the generally accepted method

## Notes on my Implementation
Each node of the tree has a number assigned to it, representing the line in which it is stored in the .csv files. Tree nodes and branches stored sequentially in files are manipulated based on this fact. Trees are numbered left to right, where the left most root is 1, it's left most branch is 2, and so on.
